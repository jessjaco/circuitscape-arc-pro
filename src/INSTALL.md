# Circuitscape Toolbox for Arc Pro

## Installation

To use this extension, unzip the release folder somewhere. Then fire up Arc Pro.
Go to the 'Catalog' pane, right click on 'Toolboxes', and select 'Add Toolbox'.
Navigate to the unzipped location and select "Circuitscape.pyt".

## Usage

The Circuitscape Toolbox shadows the full functionality of Circuitscape in Julia.
Simply parameterize and hit run. A blank black shell window will pop up, which
you can ignore. To monitor while running , select "View Details" at the bottom
of the Arc Pro Toolbox window.

Please note the first model run will take longer than usual, as the tool is
downloading, installing and testing Circuitscape.

## Known Issues

- Sometimes when you add the toolbox in Arc Pro, it doesn't appear. For now the best
solution is to exit Arc Pro and try again.
